# Story 1.7: Panel Expansion

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to expand a panel to full-screen for more detail,
**so that** I can see more information when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pressing Enter on a focused panel expands it to fill the entire screen
2. Expanded view shows the same content but with more space (longer history charts, more detail)
3. Pressing Escape or Enter again returns to the normal multi-panel view
4. Focus remains on the same panel after returning from expanded view
5. Other panels are hidden during expansion, not just overlaid

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create ExpandedPanel screen (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create src/monitor_dashboard/screens/expanded.py
  - [ ] Create ExpandedPanelScreen extending Screen
  - [ ] Accept panel_id parameter to know which panel to show
  - [ ] Clone or reference the panel content for full-screen display
  - [ ] Apply full-screen layout (entire terminal)
- [ ] Update BasePanel for expansion support (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add is_expanded property to BasePanel
  - [ ] Implement get_expanded_content() method
  - [ ] Expanded view should show more detail:
    - Longer history (more data points visible)
    - Full text (no truncation)
    - Additional stats if applicable
- [ ] Implement Enter key binding (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Add Enter binding to MonitorDashboardApp
  - [ ] Create action_toggle_expand() method
  - [ ] If on main dashboard, push ExpandedPanelScreen
  - [ ] If already expanded, pop back to main dashboard
- [ ] Implement Escape key binding (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add Escape binding (may already exist)
  - [ ] If on ExpandedPanelScreen, return to main dashboard
- [ ] Maintain focus state (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Store focused panel ID before expansion
  - [ ] Restore focus to same panel after returning
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works after return
- [ ] Continue data refresh during expansion (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Refresh loop should update expanded panel
  - [ ] History charts should continue updating
  - [ ] LED indicators should continue updating

## Dev Notes

**Expansion Flow:**
```
MainDashboard (focused: System Health)
    │
    │ User presses Enter
    ▼
ExpandedPanelScreen (full-screen System Health)
    │
    │ User presses Escape or Enter
    ▼
MainDashboard (focused: System Health)
```

**ExpandedPanelScreen Pattern:**
```python
from textual.screen import Screen

class ExpandedPanelScreen(Screen):
    """Full-screen view of a single panel."""

    def __init__(self, panel_id: str):
        super().__init__()
        self.panel_id = panel_id

    def compose(self):
        # Create expanded version of panel
        yield self._create_expanded_panel()

    def _create_expanded_panel(self):
        # Based on panel_id, create appropriate expanded view
        match self.panel_id:
            case "system-health":
                return ExpandedSystemHealthPanel()
            # ... other panels
```

**App Bindings Update:**
```python
BINDINGS = [
    # ... existing bindings
    Binding("enter", "toggle_expand", "Expand/Collapse"),
    Binding("escape", "collapse", "Return", show=False),
]

def action_toggle_expand(self) -> None:
    if isinstance(self.screen, ExpandedPanelScreen):
        self.pop_screen()
    else:
        panel_id = self.focused.id if self.focused else None
        if panel_id:
            self.push_screen(ExpandedPanelScreen(panel_id))

def action_collapse(self) -> None:
    if isinstance(self.screen, ExpandedPanelScreen):
        self.pop_screen()
```

**Expanded View Differences:**
- System Health: Longer sparklines (120 points instead of 60)
- Storage: No truncation of mount point names
- Devices: Full battery history graph
- Logs: Show more lines (100 instead of 30)

**Focus Restoration:**
```python
def action_toggle_expand(self) -> None:
    if isinstance(self.screen, ExpandedPanelScreen):
        self._stored_focus = self.screen.panel_id
        self.pop_screen()
        # After pop, restore focus
        self.call_later(self._restore_focus)
    else:
        # ... expand logic

def _restore_focus(self) -> None:
    if self._stored_focus:
        panel = self.query_one(f"#{self._stored_focus}")
        panel.focus()
```

### Testing

**Test Location:** tests/integration/

**Testing Standards:**
- Framework: pytest with textual pilot API
- Run with: `pytest tests/integration/test_app.py`

**Test Cases:**
```python
async def test_enter_expands_focused_panel():
    async with app.run_test() as pilot:
        # Focus System Health panel
        panel = app.query_one("#system-health")
        panel.focus()

        await pilot.press("enter")

        assert isinstance(app.screen, ExpandedPanelScreen)
        assert app.screen.panel_id == "system-health"

async def test_escape_returns_to_main():
    async with app.run_test() as pilot:
        await pilot.press("enter")  # Expand
        await pilot.press("escape")  # Collapse

        assert isinstance(app.screen, MainDashboard)

async def test_focus_restored_after_collapse():
    async with app.run_test() as pilot:
        panel = app.query_one("#storage")
        panel.focus()

        await pilot.press("enter")
        await pilot.press("escape")

        assert app.focused.id == "storage"
```

**Manual Verification:**
- Focus each panel and press Enter, confirm expansion
- Verify expanded view shows more content
- Press Escape, confirm return to main view
- Verify focus is on same panel
