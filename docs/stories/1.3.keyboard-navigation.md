# Story 1.3: Keyboard Navigation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to navigate between panels using keyboard shortcuts,
**so that** I can focus on different monitoring areas without using a mouse.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tab key cycles focus forward through panels (System Health → Storage → Devices → Logs → back to System Health)
2. Shift+Tab cycles focus backward through panels
3. Currently focused panel has a visual indicator (highlighted border or different color)
4. Arrow keys work within focused panel (preparation for scrollable content)
5. Navigation is modeless - keys work the same regardless of current state

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement Tab navigation (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add BINDINGS to MonitorDashboardApp for Tab and Shift+Tab
  - [ ] Create action_focus_next() method
  - [ ] Create action_focus_previous() method
  - [ ] Maintain ordered list of focusable panels
  - [ ] Cycle focus through panels in correct order
- [ ] Add focus visual indicator (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update app.tcss with :focus pseudo-class styles
  - [ ] Use highlighted border (e.g., double border or accent color)
  - [ ] Ensure focus indicator is clearly visible
- [ ] Implement arrow key handling (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add BINDINGS for Up, Down, Left, Right arrows
  - [ ] Create stub action methods for arrow keys
  - [ ] Arrow keys should be captured by focused panel (no-op for now)
- [ ] Verify modeless navigation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Ensure Tab/Shift+Tab work from any panel
  - [ ] Ensure no modal states block navigation
  - [ ] Test navigation from each panel position

## Dev Notes

**Panel Focus Order:**
1. System Health (top-left)
2. Storage (top-right)
3. Devices (bottom-left)
4. Logs (bottom-right)

Note: Info bar is NOT focusable (display-only footer)

**Textual Key Bindings:**
```python
class MonitorDashboardApp(App):
    BINDINGS = [
        Binding("tab", "focus_next", "Next Panel"),
        Binding("shift+tab", "focus_previous", "Previous Panel"),
        Binding("up", "scroll_up", "Scroll Up", show=False),
        Binding("down", "scroll_down", "Scroll Down", show=False),
        Binding("q", "quit", "Quit"),
    ]
```

**Focus Cycling Pattern:**
```python
def action_focus_next(self) -> None:
    """Move focus to next panel in cycle."""
    panels = self.query("BasePanel")
    # Find current focused panel and move to next

def action_focus_previous(self) -> None:
    """Move focus to previous panel in cycle."""
    # Reverse of focus_next
```

**Focus CSS Styles:**
```css
BasePanel:focus {
    border: double $accent;
}

BasePanel:focus-within {
    border: solid $accent;
}
```

**Modeless Navigation:**
- No vim-style modes (insert, command, etc.)
- All keys work the same regardless of current state
- Help overlay is the only "modal" but any key dismisses it

### Testing

**Test Location:** tests/integration/

**Testing Standards:**
- Framework: pytest with textual pilot API
- Run with: `pytest tests/integration/test_app.py`

**Test Cases:**
```python
async def test_tab_cycles_focus_forward():
    async with app.run_test() as pilot:
        # Initial focus should be on System Health
        assert app.focused.id == "system-health"

        await pilot.press("tab")
        assert app.focused.id == "storage"

        await pilot.press("tab")
        assert app.focused.id == "devices"

async def test_shift_tab_cycles_focus_backward():
    # Similar test for backward navigation
```

**Manual Verification:**
- Press Tab repeatedly, confirm focus cycles correctly
- Press Shift+Tab, confirm reverse cycling
- Visually confirm focus indicator is visible
